# Welcome to My Notes

This is my personal knowledge base where I document things I've learned, useful code snippets, concepts, and ideas across various topics in software development, cloud computing, and more.

## Why This Site Exists

I created this documentation site to:

1. **Organize my knowledge** in a structured, searchable format
2. **Share what I've learned** with others who might find it useful
3. **Reinforce my understanding** through the process of documenting
4. **Create a reference** I can quickly access when needed

## How to Navigate

The sidebar on the left organizes content by major topics:

- **Programming** - Code snippets, patterns, and language-specific notes
- **Cloud** - AWS services, architecture patterns, and best practices
- **Tools** - Development tools, utilities, and productivity enhancers
- **Concepts** - Broader concepts, theories, and methodologies

## About Me

I'm Farhan Ahmed, a software developer focused on building web applications and cloud solutions. You can learn more about me and my work on my [portfolio site](https://farhanahmed.pro).

Feel free to explore these notes, and I hope you find something useful!
